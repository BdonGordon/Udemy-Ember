{{!--All we need to do to render the component--}}
{{!--We have also added properties that are passed into the component: title, body. See how to access the data in my-cool-component.hbs--}}
{{my-cool-component title='Welcome to the component from Index' body='This is the body from the index'}}

{{!--Another way to define a component is by treating it like a block--}}
{{#other-cool-component title='Other Cool Component'}}
  {{!--The yield tag in the other-cool-component.hbs will render everything that is inside of this block!--}}
  <p>This is the other cool component. This will be rendered in the "yield" tag in other-cool-component.</p>
  <p>More rendered stuff</p>
{{/other-cool-component}}
